# Project Title (update me)

> One-sentence tagline that states the user outcome, not the tech.

## TL;DR
- What it does in 15 words.
- 1-2 proof points (speed, accuracy, cost, reach) with numbers if you have them.

## Team
| Name | Role / Ownership | Contact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| YOUR NAME | e.g., Product / Backend | @handle / email |
| YOUR NAME | e.g., Frontend / UX | @handle / email |

- Team name: add it here.
- Judge-ready intros: who built what.

## Problem & Users
- Who is the primary user and their top pain? (evidence or anecdote).
- Why existing workarounds are bad (time lost, errors, $$, risk).
- Success if solved (e.g., "save 2 hours per clinician per week").

## Solution
- Plain-language description of the product and how a user flows through it.
- "Magic moment" (the first time value is obvious).

### Key Features (shipped)
- [ ] Feature 1 - user value in one line.
- [ ] Feature 2 - user value in one line.
- [ ] Feature 3 - user value in one line.

### Why It's Better
- Differentiator 1 (faster, cheaper, safer, easier).
- Differentiator 2.
- Current limitations or assumptions.

- Test credentials (if needed): user / pass here.

## Screenshots
- Drop images in screenshots/ and reference them here with short captions.
- Example: ![Main flow](screenshots/demo.png)

## Architecture Overview
- Diagram: update docs/architecture.png and keep it lightweight.
- Flow (text): User -> Frontend -> Backend -> Services/DB -> Response.
- Data notes: what you store, retention, and where PII lives.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: framework, styling, state.
- Backend: language/framework; auth; background jobs.
- Database: type, ORM/migrations.
- Infra/Deploy: hosting, domains.
- APIs/Tools: LLMs, third-party APIs, monitoring.

## Data, Privacy, Security
- PII and secrets handling (env vars, encryption in transit/at rest).
- AuthZ/AuthN model; rate limits; audit/logging.

## Setup (judge-proof)
1) Prereqs: Node/Python/Docker versions here.
2) Copy env: cp .env.example .env and fill required keys (short notes per key).
3) Install:
   - Frontend: cd frontend && npm install
   - Backend: cd backend && npm install
4) Run:
   - Frontend: npm run dev
   - Backend: npm run dev
5) Seed data (if any): command here.
6) App URL: http://localhost:3000

## Testing & Quality
- Lint: command.
- Unit/E2E: command(s).
- Known failing tests (if any) and why.

## Usage Walkthrough (happy path)
1) Step-by-step path that a judge can follow to see value.
2) Include test credentials if auth is required.

## Edge Cases & Reliability
- What you handle (e.g., empty input, rate limits).
- What you do not handle yet.
- Observability: logs/metrics/traces.

## Performance
- Current latencies and any caching strategies (LLM, DB, CDN).
- Limits: concurrency, quotas.

## Future Scope
- Next 3-5 high-impact improvements with a note on effort/risk.

## Timeline (Hackathon Log)
- Day 1: problem/validation.
- Day 2: prototype.
- Day 3: polish.
